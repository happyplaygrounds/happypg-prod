      <div class="col-8"><p>Interested in learning more about who we are? Happy Playgrounds was formed in 2018, after Kelli Collins spent 5 years in the outdoor recreational industry. Prior to this, Kelli worked in the accounting world, a life full of busy seasons, deadlines, and number crunching. When the opportunity arose with Playworld, Kelli created her company, where she and her team design, build, and install playgrounds. And yes, she still has busy seasons, deadlines, and number crunching! Who would have thought public accounting and playgrounds had so much in common?!</p>
  <p>Our projects include churches, schools, parks, and HOA's across all of Oklahoma and Arkansas. Today, under the current leadership of Kelli Collins, her team has a combined 25 years of award-winning experience in the playground, shelter, and site amenities business. Our team of professionals is dedicated to designing a play experience that is perfect for you, and we are committed to providing you the very best in product and service. We strive to build a play experience that is fun, educational, inclusive, and most of all, safe!
