Deer Creek Elementary 4th and 5th Grade Center
Here we are, saying our goodbyes to the summer of 2020 and welcoming the beauty that the autumn season offers. It has been quite a busy summer for the Happy Team, and I want to share a few highlights with you.

We completed playground installations for several schools- Deer Creek 4th & 5th Grade Center, Rosewood Elementary, Jenks West Elementary, and Rockefeller Elementary.

Deer Creek 4th and 5th Grade Center, located in Edmond Oklahoma, is a new school that opened in August. The new school is surrounded by beautiful pastures, wooded countryside, and even a pumping unit!

We loved working with MA+ Architects throughout the playground design process…their eye for color and detail never ceases to amaze me. This school project set several records for Happy Playgrounds…it was the largest playground we have worked on, not only in terms of the physical size (43,000 SQ FT!!) and contract value, but at 10 color change revisions, it is in first place!

Manuel Perez Park - Oklahoma City
---

### Construction
Manuel Perez Park had their groundbreaking ceremony on Veterans Day, November 11. This is a very special park that honors the life and sacrifice of Oklahoma City native Manuel Perez Jr, who earned the Medal of Honor for his bravery and sacrifice during WWII. There is a Memorial Plaza that is dedicated to every Oklahoman who earned the Medal of Honor, but in reality, it is a beautiful tribute to all soldiers, because anyone who serves this country is a hero!

As we walked slowly throughout the park, I told him all about the items included in this park that Happy Playgrounds was a part of. I showed him the playground structure, the soft surfacing underneath it, the pavilions, and even the site amenities. I sat with him in the bench swing and explained the process of a project from bidding to completion as he gained great enjoyment from watching the children playing. He listened. He told me it was a “very nice place”. As we were driving home, I asked him what his favorite part of the park was, and he replied, “What park? Am I going to a park?”

### PlayWorld
If you haven’t visited Manuel Perez Park, I encourage you to do so. It was a pleasure to work with W.L. McNatt & Co, the general contractors, as well as Planning Design Group, the landscape architects.

We provided and installed (8) shelters by Americana Building Products, our amazing supplier. The large gathering area includes a 70x38 pavilion with a Spanish tile roof—this is beautiful! Along with that, we installed a Hexagon pavilion next to the playground, and it too, has a Spanish tiled roof. Then scattered throughout the park, you will find 6 trellis styled pergolas. Under one of these, we installed 2 bench swings which allow visitors to relax as they watch their children play. The playground area includes the Playworld Bambino, a multi-sensory playground that provides perceived risk with safe and fun activities. In addition, you will find swings, climbers, and music. I am so proud of the work we did here.

### Installation
Our amazing  installers had a constant companion throughout the project- look closely behind the orange fencing and you will see a mother goose sitting on her nest. This young mother wasn't bothered at all by us, in fact, I think she enjoyed all the "fuss" and attention we gave her to make sure she was safe and well cared for. Until next time, may peace and happiness fill you always!
