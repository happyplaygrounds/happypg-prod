Our certified Inclusive Play Design Specialists are focused on bringing the ability to enjoy and share in the holistic benefits of play to everyone! Inclusion is more than access—it’s about being and feeling a part of something. It’s about making a difference in the lives of others. It's about happiness for all.</p>
