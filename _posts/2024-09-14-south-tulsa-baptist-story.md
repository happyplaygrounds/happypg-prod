<h2>Partner Spotlight: South Tulsa Baptist</h2>
<h3>A Dream Playground Coming to Life</h3>

One of the most rewarding parts of our work is seeing a community’s vision become real. South Tulsa Baptist is doing exactly that—creating a joyful, safe space where children can play, grow, and thrive.

Debbie Steen with South Tulsa Baptist is seeing her dream come to life, and we’re grateful to be part of a project that will serve their kids and families for years to come.
