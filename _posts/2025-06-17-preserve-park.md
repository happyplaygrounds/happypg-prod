  <title>Revitalizing Preserve Park</title>

  <h1>Revitalizing Preserve Park:<br></h1> 
  <h3>A Springtime Turf Transformation in <br> Broken Arrow </h3>

  Spring showers couldn’t dampen our spirits at <strong>Happy Playgrounds LLC</strong> as we teamed up with the <strong>[City of Broken Arrow] [BA]</strong> to give Preserve Park a fresh, low-maintenance makeover. What was once a playground blanketed by 16 inches of aged mulch has been reborn lush and green—just in time for Memorial Day festivities.

  <h3>Tackling 16 Inches of Mulch—and Then Some</h3>

  Beneath the playground equipment lay a deep bed of aging mulch, accumulated over years of active community use. Our crew carefully removed every inch, ensuring no stray pieces would compromise the new surface. Once the mulch was gone, we installed a robust rock sub-base to guarantee proper drainage and long-term stability. It was a labor-intensive phase, but seeing the perfect foundation emerge made every scoop worthwhile.

  <h3>Racing Against the Rain</h3>

  Late-spring weather in northeastern Oklahoma is legendary for its unpredictability—and 2025 did not disappoint. Thunderstorms rolled in almost daily, threatening to wash away progress. Still, armed with tarps, temporary drainage channels, and a determined team, we capitalized on every dry hour. In the span of just a few workable days, turf panels were unrolled, seams locked, infill applied, and edges secured.

  <h4>Ahead of Memorial Day, Ahead of Expectations</h4>

  Despite Mother Nature’s mood swings, we wrapped up the project with days to spare before Memorial Day weekend. Park visitors arrived to find a welcoming, vibrant space that’s not only safe and ADA-friendly, but also extremely low maintenance—no more mulch to rake or replace.

    “It’s moments like these—when community, craftsmanship, and tight deadlines align—that make our work so rewarding,” says <strong>Justin McElhany</strong>, Project Manager at Happy Playgrounds LLC.

  <h3>Looking Forward: A Lasting Partnership</h3>

  We’re incredibly proud to support the City of Broken Arrow in enhancing its parks. Preserve Park’s transformation is just the start: featuring synthetic turf that holds up to rain, sun, and play, it offers families more time to enjoy the outdoors with less maintenance required. We look forward to building on this success and collaborating on future projects that bring joy, safety, and beauty to Broken Arrow’s outdoor spaces.
