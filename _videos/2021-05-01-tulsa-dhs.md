Department of Human Services

The Department of Human Services here in Tulsa moved their headquarters to a new location, and wanted a small playground installed for the families that visit. The building had the perfect set up; there was an existing patio, enclosed with wrought iron fencing, and this is where we installed the new structure. The playground unit we chose packs a lot of “punch” given the size of it, and the poured in place surfacing adds the finishing touch. This was completed in July 2021.
