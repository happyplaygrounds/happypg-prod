Hello, and welcome to our new website!

I am very excited about the new information we are offering here, and grateful to those that put so many hours and creativity into producing this. I want to offer a sincere thank you to Second Wind Consulting. Their team of web developers offered a great deal of insight, new ideas, dynamic and responsive web pages that resulted in an amazing, state of the art website for Happy Playgrounds! I also have to give a “shout out” to Daniel Collins…my youngest son…whose eye for detail never seizes to amaze me. Daniel put hours and hours in accumulating photographs and information that you see. In fact, the images and gallery were all created by him.  Both Second Wind and Daniel were more than patient with me when I would agree with a decision, only to change my mind a time or two, causing them to re-work a site or start from scratch… a woman’s prerogative, right?!  I hope you will enjoy perusing through www.happyplaygrounds.com!

The blog is a new component for our website as well as me. In fact, I have never blogged a day in my life. But here I go!

May 1, 2019 marked the first-year anniversary for Happy Playgrounds, and what a great year it has been! Starting a business is not an easy choice for anyone, especially those that are in a “comfort zone” as I was. Allow me to tell you how it all began…

I had been working in the commercial playground industry for a few years, and one of my clients was the Little Rock School District. I worked closely with the guys in the Facility and Maintenance Department, and was responsible for providing all of the surfacing needs and repairs at their 30 elementary schools. This school district has a lot of playground equipment, and I had the opportunity to learn a great deal about each manufacturer. What I noticed was the uniqueness and extraordinary quality of the Playworld playground equipment, and I specifically remember thinking how awesome it would be to represent this line of equipment.

Fast forward about a year. I was sitting in my office when I received a phone call from a gentleman at Playworld Systems who introduced himself as the Director of Sales. I learned about changes in their company, and the next thing I know, he offered me Oklahoma and Arkansas territories. I was ecstatic. I was nervous. I was wide-eyed thinking about starting my own business; after all, I was in a comfort zone where I was! But as I thought about it, I realized this: The primary ingredients for a successful business includes an excellent product, a customer service mind set, and a will to succeed.  I had all three, so I dove right in. It was the best business decision I have ever made, and I can honestly say that I wake up every morning with a grateful heart and excited to begin my day. I love what I do, I love my team, and I love the people I am privileged to work with each and every day.

Until my next post, may happiness fill your heart and soul.
