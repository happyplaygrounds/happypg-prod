      <h5>Outdoor Athletic Equipment...an Adult's Playground!</h5>
<br />
<p>An unfortunate fact in America today involves the obesity rate. As of 2016, 37.9% of men, and 41.1% of women are obese. Cities and municipalities are aware of this and are actively doing their part to help combat this growing problem. Happy Playgrounds is pleased to have been involved in numerous outdoor athletic projects.</p>
<p>With free use of outdoor fitness zones, the public has access to high quality fitness equipment. Our primary source for our fitness equipment is Greenfields. They have been pursuing their goal of fighting obesity since 2007.</p>
