Happy Playgrounds completed our latest playground at the Southside Early Childhood Head Start Broken Arrow, OK location, and what a transformation!  This new play space has it all from an exciting new Playworld structure to new synthetic turf safety surfacing as well as a new fabric shade that will help keep the toddlers cool in the summer.

We poured a new concrete tricycle track that surrounds the play space, so the kiddos can stop and "fill up" before attending a concert at the new Music Store!

There are many more features like the Balance Trax that helps to develop core strength, while the Moon Rock Climber and the Silly Tree will offer climbing opportunities, as well as sensory and imaginative play! 

This playground has it all! Amber Fitzgerald, our early childhood specialist, did an outstanding job designing this playground!

We are so proud of how hard our crews worked to complete this installation. They worked through rain and freezing temperatures to complete this job.
