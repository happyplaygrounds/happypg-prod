The [Town of Washington][TWA] has officially completed an exciting park improvement project with the installation of a brand-new playground—finished just ahead of the winter weather.

Happy Playgrounds was proud to partner with the Town to bring this space to life. This project adds the final piece to a growing community park, providing new recreational opportunities for local families. Despite the approaching seasonal weather, our team successfully completed the installation on schedule.

The new playground features a Playworld® structure designed for children ages 5–12 to encourage imagination and active play. To complement the equipment, we installed synthetic turf for a clean, durable, and low-maintenance surface, along with concrete curb edging for added stability and safety.

This playground serves as the finishing touch to the park’s recent upgrades, which also include a new basketball court. Together, these amenities create a well-rounded space for recreation and community gathering.
