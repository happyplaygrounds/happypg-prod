  "How many of us remember nothing but blacktop underneath our jungle gyms and monkey bars? Times have certainly changed, and that is a good thing! Happy Playgrounds is proud to represent a variety of surfacing products from the industry's most innovative manufacturers. Our partners use the most environmentally friendly, premium materials available. It's about a sustainable legacy of great play, which starts with the surface underneath."

  <b>The surface beneath your playground is just as important as the equipment above it.</b>  Falls are the leading cause of playground injuries, and choosing the right surfacing can significantly reduce risk while supporting inclusive, accessible play for all. While grass or packed earth might appear soft, they quickly become compacted, uneven, and slippery—offering little to no real fall protection. These surfaces don't meet ASTM safety standards and can increase the risk of injury from even low-height falls. That’s where Zeager Brothers comes in. Their engineered wood fiber (EWF) is purpose-built to absorb impact, promote drainage, and stay consistent over time. Both options meet critical safety and accessibility requirements, offering peace of mind for schools, parks, and communities.With Zeager, you're not just covering the ground—you’re laying the groundwork for safer, more inclusive play.
