	     "Our line of shelters and pavilions offer a variety of styles that will compliment your space and work within your budget."
  <cite>Kelli Collins</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Outdoor shelters and pavilions allow families and friends to gather together to enjoy cookouts, birthday parties, reunions, and more. Not only do they serve a functional purpose, but they are also aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Our shelters are manufactured by Americana Outdoors, and we would love to help you add one to your park. Americana has a shelter that is perfect for you and your budget.</p>
