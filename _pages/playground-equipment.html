<h4>Inclusive Play</h4>
<p>Are you interested in a playground that is genuinely inclusive for all people? One of our principles at Happy Playgrounds is designing a playground that truly everyone can engage in and that brings together people from every stretch of the community. Recreational areas need to be enjoyed by individuals with and without challenges to foster opportunities for engagement with one another. We have a framework that will promote that type of play. Our certified Inclusive Play Design Specialists are focused on bringing the ability to enjoy and share in the holistic benefits of play to everyone! Inclusion is more than access—it’s about being and feeling a part of something. It’s about making a difference in the lives of others. It's about happiness for all.</p>
