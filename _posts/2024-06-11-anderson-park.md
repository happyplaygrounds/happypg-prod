Anderson Park in Edmond, Oklahoma is soon to be open to the public! The park will include a new Playworld playground, as well as a new splashpad. Our team here at Happy had such fun designing this one.

We knew we wanted to offer Edmond a playground that was unique and challenging, so we did!

Anderson Park's new playground includes rope play, plenty of climbing, swinging,  and the amazing, one of a kind Mighty Descent Slide! The surfacing is synthetic turf. It turned out awesome!

It's fun to know how the [City of Edmond] [CE] chose us over the other designs submitted. After narrowing down the options, the Parks Department visited the nearby elementary school with designs in tow. They laid them all out on a table, and asked the children to vote on their favorite playground. We were told that our design was "hands down the favorite"!
