     <blockquote>
	     "Play spaces should incorporate universal design; the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood, and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their age, size, ability, or disability."
  <cite>Kelli Collins</cite>
    </blockquote>

        <p>Are you interested in a playground that is genuinely inclusive for all people? One of our principles at Happy Playgrounds is designing a playground that truly everyone can engage in and that brings together people from every stretch of the community. Recreational areas need to be enjoyed by both individuals with and without challenges to foster opportunities for engagement with one another. </p>
<p>
We have a framework that will promote that type of play. We have certified Inclusive Play Design Specialists that are focused on bringing the ability to enjoy and share in the holistic benefits of play to everyone! Inclusion is more than access—it’s about being and feeling a part of something. It’s about making a difference in the lives of others. It's about happiness for all.</p>
<p> Our customers choose to go with Happy Playgrounds because we truly know and understand the products we carry. We are passionate about Play. </p>
