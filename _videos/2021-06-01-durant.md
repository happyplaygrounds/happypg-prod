Choctaw Child Development Center

The child development center in Durant, OK, was built for the children of the employees of the Choctaw Nation. We completed this project in September 2021, and it is incredible. There are two playground areas; one for the younger children ages 6 mo-2 years, and the other one is for children ages 3-5. There is a total of 18000SF of play space. The surfacing is synthetic turf with berms and bowls, and it is almost entirely covered with shade. We worked closely with the landscape architect, Carter Design Group, as well as the construction managers, Manhattan Construction Company. Albert Tipton of Carter Design Group was the LA, and I admire his thorough understanding of how cooperative play enriches the lives
